## Assignment text
Given an API-call that lists information about Bitcoin the last 100 days.
Create a website that displays the information in a styled tabell with a minimum of 4 columns.
The tabell should only display 20 days at the time, but it should be possible to traverse through all the days
with the help of pagination.

Some requirements:
- write the logic for pagination without use of library.
- we expect the tabell and the rest of the website to be styled.
